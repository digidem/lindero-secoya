In August the Digital Democracy team travelled down to Ecuador to experiment with using a DJI Phantom drone for community mapping and monitoring. The indigenous Secoya community that we worked with asked for help documenting a land invasion and deforestation of their land title. We visited the area with a team from teh community and documented the invasion and created a composite of imagery from the drone, which is shown in this interactive map. The background imagery is aerial photography from an unknown source about 10 years ago. The slider allows you to easily see before and after images.

This is just a prototype to get this information online. We continue to look at the best way of publishing and sharing this information and support the local communities in Ecuador to continue to use the drone to document this type of issue (we left the DJI Phantom with the local organization for them to continue to use).
